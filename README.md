# colorpage
This is my first *repository*, I am thinking about creating a *TCP socket* based page that people can color all at once.
* This site will be open source
* It will be fun
* It will be simple
  * I am intanding to build it based on the lean startup model
something like the ![*million dollar homepage*]()
